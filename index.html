	<h1>UNIVERSAL FEATURAL ALPHABET v.1</h1>
	<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
	<p>
		This is an experimental writing system inspired by IPA, Hangeul, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INJCvOAQzYk">Artifexian's Oa</a>. <br />
		It has no real life use, but I think it's pretty easy to learn, and can be applied to practically any language. <br />
		It's written left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  <br />
		It is written as it is pronounced, so a word like "through" will be written with three symbols, not seven. <br />
		All vowels are 2*1 units and have a vertical stroke, while all consonants are 1*2 and have a horizontal stroke.
	</p>
	<h2>CONSONANTS</h2>
	<p>
		The spelling of every consonant is determined by its place of articulation, its manner of articulation and its voiceness.
	</p>
	<h3>PLACE OF ARTICULATION</h3>
	<p>
		The places of articulation are as follows: bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, retroflex, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, epiglottal, glottal. Each is shown as a unique stroke under the horizontal line.<br />
		<img src="img/places of articulation.png"/><br />
		
		The choice of strokes is to visualise the places of articulation. The leftmost vertical stroke represents lips/teeth, the middle one represents the roof of the mouth, and the rightmost one - the back of the mouth and the larynx. <br />
		
		If you put epiglottals after palatals, the whole sequence is a mirror copy of itself, with the palatals in the center. Which is kinda awesome.<br />
		<img src="img/places of articulation wrong.png"/><br />
		Labiovelars, labiopalatals and postalveolars are shown as two strokes. <br />
		<img src="img/double places of articulation.png"/><br />
		For any other secondary articulation, you can write a half-stroke corrresponding to the secondary place of articulation. <br />
		Aspiration is also shown this way, corresponding to glottal articulation. <br />

		(Don't mind the stroke below, by the way. That's because of /k/, not because of secondary articulations. The specifics are explained further below.)
	</p>
	<h3>MANNER OF ARTICULATION</h3>
	<p>
		Every manner of articulation is represented by specific modifications to the glyph. <br />
		Nasals have an additional stroke above, representing the passage of air through the nose. <br />
		<img src="img/nasals.png"/> <br />
		Plosives have a stroke below. <br />
		<img src="img/plosives.png"/> <br />
		Affricates have a bracket-like stroke below. <br />
		<img src="img/affricates.png"/> <br />
		Fricatives, arguably the most diverse single manner of articulation, does not have modifications, so it's in a way a default option. <br />
		<img src="img/fricatives.png"/> <br />
		Approximants replace the straight strokes representing the places of articulation with smoother, wavelike ones. This represents the smooth, frictionless flow they create. <br />
		<img src="img/approximants.png"/> <br />
		Trills replace the straight strokes with sawtooth-like ones instead. This represents the vibration they create. <br />
		<img src="img/trills.png"/> <br />
		Taps or flaps are like trills, but they only replace the upper half of the stroke. This represents the one period of vibration compared to several in trills. <br />
		<img src="img/taps.png"/> <br />
		Laterals are represented with a squished V-shape above. The V-shape represents the split airstream. Since it's written above, it allows for lateral fricatives, affricates, approximants, taps or even trills without further complications. <br />
		<img src="img/laterals.png"/> <br />
	</p>
	<h3>VOICENESS</h3>
	<p>
		Most languages have voiceless obstruents (i.e. plosives, affricates and fricatives) and voiced sonorants (i.e. approximants, trills, taps and nasals). Thus, in UFA, a horizontal stroke is drawn in the middle of the consonant to make an obstruent voiced, or to make a sonorant voiceless.
		<img src="img/voiceness.png"/> <br />
	</p>
	<h3>ADDITIONAL DETAILS</h3>
	<p>
		While the UFA is not particularly intended for non-pulmonic consonants, it can be modified in the future to include ejectives, clicks and implosives. <br />
		Geminates are represented with double strokes for articulation. Half-strokes (secondary articulation or aspiration) don't get doubled. For the purpose of simplifying glyphs, horizontal parts of the stroke don't get doubled as well. (If anyone has an idea how to make wavey lines look nicer, let me know.)<br />
		<img src="img/geminates.png"/> <br />
		If your language distinguishes palatoalveolars from alveolopalatals, and for whatever reason thinking of palatoalveolars as retroflex is off the table, you can represent alveolopalatals as palatalised palatoalveolars. I honestly don't know any lnaguage that would be put in this horrible position.<br />

	</p>
	<h2>VOWELS</h2>
	<p>
		Vowels are characterised by height, backness and roundness, as well as (in some languages) length. <br />
		Every vowel has a stroke, its position is determined by height and backness.  <br />
		Close vowels have a top stroke, mid vowels - a middle stroke, open vowels - a bottom stroke. <br />
		<img src="img/vowel height.png"/> <br />
		In front vowels, the articulation stroke is entirely to the left of the vertical stroke; in back vowels, it's entirely to the right. In central vowels, it intersects the vertical stroke. <br />
		<img src="img/vowel backness.png"/> <br />
		If your language distinguishes more than three vowel heights, you can write open-mid and close-mid vowels as two strokes (open and mid, or close and mid), whose ends are brought together to form a triangle. <br />
		<img src="img/more vowel heights.png"/> <br />
		Near-open and near-close vowels are written as their cardinal counterparts, but with an additional stroke going from the end(s) of the articulation stroke to the middle of the vertical stroke. <br />
		<img src="img/near vowels.png"/> <br />
		Rounded vowels are represented with doubled articulation strokes. <br />
		<img src="img/rounded.png"/> <br />
		Long vowels are represented with a doubled vertical stroke. <br />
		<img src="img/long vowels.png"/> <br />
		Diphthongs are shown as two vowel symbols connected by a tie above. <br />
		<img src="img/diphthong.png"/> <br />
		<!--Nasal vowel are represented with a horizontal stroke above, just like in consonants. <br />
		Rhotic vowels are written with a tiny /ɹ/ descending from the articulation stroke. <br />-->
